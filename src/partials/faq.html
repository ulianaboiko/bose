              Firstly, make sure your headphones are turned on with a single
              press of the top button on the back of the right earbud. Then
              press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to put the
              headphones into pairing mode. Please note that if you connect the
              headphones for the first time, they will automatically turn on
              immediately in this pairing mode. Voice prompts will provide you
              with additional instructions. We recommend that you use the Bose
              Music app to complete the pairing process, however you can also
              use the Bluetooth settings on your device.
